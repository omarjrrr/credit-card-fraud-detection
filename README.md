# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

Fraudulent credit card transactions are rare but highly impactful.  
This project demonstrates how to build machine learning models that can **detect fraud effectively in an imbalanced dataset**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
- The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.  
- It is highly imbalanced: fraud cases are only **0.17%** of all transactions.  
- The notebook explores **data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation**.  

---

## ✨ Features
✔️ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✔️ Handling imbalanced datasets (undersampling / oversampling)  
✔️ Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
✔️ Model evaluation using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- ROC-AUC  

✔️ Visualization of model performance
